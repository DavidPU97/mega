## The Development

I used two components in Angular, one for displaying all the orders and one for displaying just the details of the selected order. To achieve this, I have first parsed the JSON file to a TS object (which I also made), saved it to a variable and iterated trough it with ngFor. To keep it simple, I elected to display the order details on the same page, so I passed the selected order to the other component using @Input and displayed it there. To enhance readibility I used Bootstrap. 

## The connection with my CV
I have worked in England for six months and used Angular for the most part of the internship, so I'm familiar with it.
